## 🎯 Overview

**WhaleFlow Radar** is a sophisticated whale tracking system that monitors large transactions across major blockchains and provides predictive analytics on whale behavior patterns.

This system uses advanced AI clustering algorithms to identify and track whale movements across 15+ blockchains, providing unprecedented insights into market-moving transactions before they impact prices.

### What Makes It Special

Unlike simple transaction alerts, WhaleFlow Radar uses **machine learning to predict whale behavior**. The system can identify when whales are likely to dump, accumulate, or rotate between assets **before they execute trades**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 Core Intelligence
- **Cross-chain whale tracking** across 15+ networks (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, etc.)
- **AI clustering algorithms** to identify wallets belonging to the same entity
- **Predictive analytics** - ML models that predict whale actions based on historical patterns
- **Impact scoring** - calculates potential market impact of detected whale movements

### 🧠 Advanced Analytics
- **Portfolio reconstruction** - estimates complete whale holdings across chains
- **Trading pattern analysis** - identifies whale trading strategies and timing
- **Flow analysis** - tracks fund movements between exchanges, DeFi protocols, and cold storage
- **Profit/loss tracking** for major whale wallets
- **Correlation analysis** between whale actions and price movements

### 🚀 Premium Features *(Coming Soon)*
- **Social sentiment integration** - correlates whale activity with Twitter/Discord sentiment
- **Custom alert system** with Telegram/Discord/Email notifications
- **Real-time API access** for institutional clients
- **Mobile app** with push notifications
